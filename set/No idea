Explanation

You gain  unit of happiness for elements  and  in set . You lose  unit for  in set . The element  in set  does not exist in the array so it is not included in the calculation.

Hence, the total happiness is 2-1=1


-----Python code----

n,m = input().split()
arr = input().split()
count =0
count1=0
A = set(input().split())
B = set(input().split())
for i in arr:
    if i in A:
        count= count+1
    if i in B:
        count1=count1+1
print(count-count1)
